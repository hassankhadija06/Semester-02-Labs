# 🧪 C++ Lab 2 – OOP Concepts in Practice

This project is a continuation of exploring Object-Oriented Programming in C++. It includes simulation of:

- ✅ Basic class creation and usage (`Employee`)
- ✅ Parameterized constructors and validation logic (`BankAccount`)
- ✅ Constructor overloading (`Rectangle`)
- ✅ Stack vs Heap memory and constructor/destructor behavior (`Locker`)
