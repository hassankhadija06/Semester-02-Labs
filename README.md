# üéì 2nd Semester C++ Lab Collection

Welcome to my curated collection of C++ lab tasks from the 2nd semester.  
This repository showcases my progress and understanding of core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and foundational C++ programming skills.

## üß† What's Inside?

A series of structured and practical lab assignments designed to:

- Strengthen C++ fundamentals
- Practice real-world OOP applications
- Learn through building interactive, menu-driven programs

---

## üîç Lab Breakdown

### ‚úÖ **Lab 1: Introduction to OOP**
- Deep Copy simulation using custom classes
- Single Inheritance and constructor chaining
- Hands-on with objects and encapsulation

### ‚úÖ **Lab 2: Constructors & Memory Management**
- Default and parameterized constructors
- Destructor calls in stack vs heap memory
- Banking, employee, and locker simulations

### ‚úÖ **Lab 3: Interactive Utilities & Validation**
- Menu-based temperature converter (Celsius ‚Üí Fahrenheit)
- Product and inventory management with input validation
- Student record system, voter eligibility checker, and basic calculator

## üöÄ How to Compile & Run

Each lab can be compiled independently using any C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o lab_output
./lab_output
```

> üí° Tip: Uncomment the relevant code blocks inside `main.cpp` to run the desired task.

## üìå Learning Outcomes

- ‚úÖ Mastered class structures, objects, and methods
- ‚úÖ Practiced constructor overloading and data validation
- ‚úÖ Explored memory management and destructor behavior
- ‚úÖ Built real-world inspired utilities from scratch
