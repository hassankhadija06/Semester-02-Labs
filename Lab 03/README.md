# 🧠 C++ OOP Concepts Simulator

These lab tasks demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++ using simple, interactive examples. It includes:

- ✅ Deep Copy demonstration using `BankAccount` class
- ✅ Single Inheritance with `Student` inheriting from `Person`
- ✅ Constructor behavior in inheritance with `Rectangle` and `Shape` classes
